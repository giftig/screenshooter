# Screenshooter

Simple screenshotter utility written in Scala for Ammonite. Provides a simple
way of screenshotting a portion of the screen quickly and easily and in a
cross-platform way.

You'll need [Ammonite](https://github.com/lihaoyi/Ammonite) to run this script;
it's trivial to compile it into a jar instead if needed, though.
